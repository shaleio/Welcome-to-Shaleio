## **3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP**

Contributors retain full ownership of all original intellectual property they create.

By submitting a Licensed Work for certification, the Contributor grants Shaleio LLC a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive license to:

* distribute,
* certify,
* sublicense, and
* resell

the Licensed Work **within the Shaleio licensing framework only**.

Contributors may freely relicense or commercialize their work outside this framework without payment to Shaleio LLC.

Contributors retain all liability for any services, consulting engagements, or client-facing obligations.
Shaleio LLC is not a party to Contributor–client contracts.

### 3.1 Operational Continuity and Security Patch Rights

For the sole purposes of security, regulatory compliance, operational continuity, or critical functionality, the Contributor grants ShaleIO LLC a limited, non-exclusive right to modify, patch, or update the Licensed Work as reasonably necessary to:

- remediate security vulnerabilities,
- maintain compatibility with required third-party services,
- address breaking changes in dependent systems,
- or ensure continued functionality of Certified Products.

Any such modification must:

- preserve the Contributor’s ownership of all original intellectual property;
- not create derivative ownership rights for Shaleio LLC;
- be documented and provided to the Contributor for review and incorporation into their canonical version;
- not constitute a Material Enhancement for purposes of royalty allocation.
- Shaleio LLC shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Contributor of required changes prior to implementation, except where immediate action is necessary to address urgent security or operational risks.

## **4. ROYALTY DISTRIBUTION MODEL**

All sales of Certified Products follow the fixed revenue structure below.

### **4.1 Sales Through Shaleio LLC**

For each sale:

* **15%** → Shaleio LLC (Administrative Licensing Fee)
* **85%** → Royalty Distribution Structure

### **4.2 Original Contributor Allocation**

The original Contributor receives a perpetual, non-dilutable **30%** of the Royalty Distribution Structure.

### **4.3 Enhancement Royalty Pools**

Each Material Enhancement approved as a major version upgrade creates a permanent Enhancement Royalty Pool:

* **Pool A** (first enhancement)
* **Pool B** (second enhancement)
* **Pool C** (third enhancement)

Example for a $100 sale:

* $15 → Shaleio LLC
* $85 → Royalty Distribution Structure

  * Original Contributor: $25.50
  * Pool A: $34.00
  * Pool B: $25.50

### **4.4 Enhancements Beyond Pool C**

After the third major enhancement, the Licensing Review Committee will determine whether the contribution constitutes:

* a new Certified Product,
* a limited royalty pool, or
* maintenance or bounty-only work.

The Licensing Executive’s final determination is binding within the scope of this License.

---

### **4.5 Bounty Contributors**

Work classified as maintenance-level contributions shall be designated as Bounty Contributions and do not create or participate in any Royalty Pools.


## **5. INDEPENDENT SALES BY CONTRIBUTORS**

Contributors may independently sell Licensed Works governed by this License.

Revenue allocation:

* **90%** → Contributor
* **10%** → Shaleio LLC (Independent Sales Fee)

Payments are due within 60 days of receipt.

Independent sales must maintain required attribution and Contribution Records.

## **6. EXTERNAL LICENSING OUTSIDE THIS LICENSE**

Contributors may sell, modify, or relicense their original work outside the Shaleio licensing framework with:

* no fee,
* no obligation, and
* no revenue share owed to Shaleio LLC.

Externally licensed products may not claim SGL certification or use any Shaleio trademarks or certification marks.

---

## **7. THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS**

### **7.1 Definition of a Distribution Event**

Any resale or listing of a Certified Product on a public digital marketplace constitutes a Distribution Event, distinct from consulting-based deployment.

### **7.2 Authorization Requirement**

Distribution Events are prohibited unless the reseller is a Shaleio-approved **Certified Distributor**.

### **7.3 Distributor Obligations**

Certified Distributors must comply with Shaleio standards, including:

* pricing restrictions,
* discount limitations,
* verification requirements,
* quality standards, and
* revenue-sharing obligations.

### **7.4 Unauthorized Resale**

Unauthorized marketplace listings, derivative storefronts, rebranded catalogs, or attempts to bypass certification constitute a material breach.

### **7.5 Consulting Deployments**

Consulting firms may deploy Certified Products for clients without obtaining Distributor certification, subject to a 15% Consulting Deployment Fee payable to ShaleIO LLC, calculated on the gross value of the client contract associated with the deployment.

Shaleio LLC shall allocate the Consulting Deployment Fee as follows:

15% retained by ShaleIO LLC as the Administrative Licensing Fee;

85% distributed through the Royalty Distribution Structure to the Original Contributor and applicable Enhancement Royalty Pools.

Payments are due within 60 days of receipt of client funds.
