# Shaleio Guild License (SGL™) v1.3 — LEGALLY HARDENED DRAFT

**Effective Date:** TBD (2025)
**Copyright © 2025 ShaleIO LLC and Individual Builders**

---

# 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The Shaleio Guild License (SGL™) governs:

* distribution,
* resale,
* certification,
* and revenue‑sharing

of products (“Strata”) distributed under the ShaleIO Guild ecosystem.

This License regulates **Guild‑related commerce only**. Builders retain full independence and may freely use their IP outside the Guild.

All rights not expressly granted by this License are **reserved** by Builders and ShaleIO.

---

# 2. DEFINITIONS

**Builder** — An independent creator or LLC contributing original IP to any Guild-governed work.

**Licensed Work** — Any code, artifacts, or products submitted to the Guild, or distributed under the SGL.

**Strata** — A Guild‑certified, slice‑based, revenue‑sharing product.

**Royalty Engine** — The portion of revenue (85%) allocated to Builders and Reforge Pools.

**Commercial Use** — Any sale, deployment, integration, licensing, or use of a Licensed Work in exchange for money, services, resources, or enterprise benefit.

**Net Revenue** — Total received funds **minus**:

* mandatory taxes,
* transaction fees,
* direct hosting/distribution costs.

No indirect, administrative, or internal costs may be deducted.

---

# 3. BUILDER OWNERSHIP (THE BUILDER OWNS)

Builders retain **full intellectual-property ownership** of all original work.

Submitting a Licensed Work to the Guild grants ShaleIO a **perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license** to:

* distribute,
* certify,
* sublicense,
* and resell

within the Guild ecosystem **only**.

Builders may freely relicense or commercialize their work **outside** the Guild under any terms they choose.

The Builder owns:

* the work,
* the rights,
* and **the liability** for any Builder–Client contract.

The Guild is **never** a contracting party.

---

# 4. ROYALTY MODEL (SLICE-BASED REFORGE SYSTEM)

All Guild sales follow a fixed structure:

### 4.1 Guild Marketplace Sales

From each sale:

* **15%** → ShaleIO Guild (stewardship fee)
* **85%** → Royalty Engine

### 4.2 Original Builder (OB) Floor

The Original Builder receives a **permanent, non-dilutable floor of 30%** of the Royalty Engine.

### 4.3 Reforge Pools

A “Reforge” occurs when a Builder materially improves, extends, or restructures a Strata.

Each major Reforge creates a new, permanent royalty slice:

* Reforge 1 Pool (R1)
* Reforge 2 Pool (R2)
* Reforge 3 Pool (R3)

Payout example for $100 sale:

* $15 → Guild
* $85 → Royalty Engine

  * OB: 30% of $85 = **$25.50**
  * R1 pool: 40% of $85 = **$34.00**
  * R2 pool: 30% of $85 = **$25.50**

### 4.4 Reforge 4 and Beyond (Arbitration Zone)

After the third major Reforge, the Stewards review any further contribution to determine whether it is:

* a new Strata,
* a new limited royalty pool,
* or bounty-only maintenance.

**The Guild’s ruling is final within the Guild ecosystem.**

---

# 5. INDEPENDENT SALES UNDER SGL (TITHE SYSTEM)

Builders may sell their own SGL-governed works independently.

Revenue share:

* **90%** → Builder(s)
* **10%** → ShaleIO Guild (tithe)

Payments due within **60 days**.

Independent SGL use maintains lineage, brand integrity, and royalty slices.

---

# 6. NON-SGL INDEPENDENT SALES (BUILDER FREEDOM)

Builders may sell, modify, or relicense their work **outside** the SGL with:

* no tithe,
* no obligation,
* and no revenue share owed to ShaleIO.

These products may not claim Guild certification or use Guild marks.

---

# 7. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

All Licensed Works must preserve:

* original Builder attribution,
* Strata lineage if applicable,
* Guild certification mark if distributed through Guild channels.

Attribution must be:

* visible,
* unambiguous,
* and retained in derivative works.

Removing attribution terminates the License.

---

# 8. TRADEMARKS AND GUILD MARKS

“ShaleIO,” “ShaleIO Guild,” “Strata,” and the **Seal of the Forge** are Guild trademarks.

Use is prohibited without explicit authorization.

Misuse of Guild marks results in immediate revocation of SGL rights.

---

# 9. WARRANTY & LIABILITY DISCLAIMERS

All Licensed Works are provided **"AS IS,"** without any warranty.

ShaleIO and Builders disclaim all liability for:

* indirect,
* incidental,
* special,
* punitive,
* consequential,
* or lost-profit damages.

Nothing in this License obligates the Guild or any Builder to provide support, updates, fixes, or maintenance.

Builders bear full responsibility for their deliverables in all client engagements.
