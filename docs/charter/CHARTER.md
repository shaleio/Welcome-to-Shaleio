# ShaleIO Guild Charter — Draft v1.0

Status: Pre-Guild Era
Effective Upon Activation of the First Five

## 1. Purpose of the Guild

### The ShaleIO Guild exists to:

- empower independent Builders to create, own, and sell cloud-native software and infrastructure artifacts;
- maintain product lineage and quality through structured reforges, patches, and version governance;
- provide clients with lifecycle confidence through Guild-backed certification and stewardship;
- preserve Builder sovereignty while enabling collective economic acceleration.

The Guild is not an employer, vendor-of-record, or contracting entity.
The Guild provides stewardship, certification, governance, and ecosystem support.

## 2. Core Principles
### 2.1 The Builder Owns

Builders retain full intellectual-property ownership, rights, and responsibility for their work.
Liability for deliverables remains fully with each Builder or their LLC.

### 2.2 The Guild Stewards

The Guild manages governance, certification, lineage, maintenance funds, and economic frameworks.
The Guild never assumes operational or contractual liability.

### 2.3 Sovereignty Over Hierarchy

Builders are independent entities.
The Guild imposes no employer-style control or obligations.

### 2.4 Transparency and Fairness

Royalty splits, lineage rules, attribution, and arbitration decisions follow published, consistent processes.

### 2.5 Craft Above Ego

Contribution quality, clarity, and reliability take precedence over personality, politics, or seniority.

## 3. Guild Structure
### 3.1 The Guildmaster

The founder of the Guild during the Pre-Guild Era.
Responsible for:

- interpreting the Charter,
- maintaining the SGL,
- overseeing lineage and reforge rulings,
- activating the Guild upon completion of the Path of the First Five,
- ensuring the Guild remains aligned with core principles.
- The Guildmaster does not own Builder IP and does not override Builder sovereignty.

### 3.2 Stewards (Phase 3)

- Stewards are appointed after Guild activation to:
- review reforge submissions,
- arbitrate lineage and slice assignments,
- approve maintenance-funded work,
- protect the integrity of Guild marks,
- uphold transparent governance.
- Stewards are administrators, not owners.

### 3.3 Builders

- Independent engineers or LLCs who:
- contribute original work,
- submit reforges,
- respect lineage rules,
- adhere to the SGL,
- maintain professional conduct within the Guild.
- Builders may come and go freely.
- They are autonomous and retain full freedom.

## 4. The Path of the First Five

The Guild is not active until the First Five Builders demonstrate:

- formation of their LLC,
- acceptance of the Charter, NDA, SGL,
- contribution to or creation of a Strata,
- understanding of lineage and reforges,
- honorable engagement with the community.

Upon the recognition of the Fifth Builder, the Guild is formally activated, Stewards may be appointed, and Phase 2/3 operations may begin.

## 5. Strata & Lineage Governance
### 5.1 ShaleIO Strata

Guild-certified products governed by the SGL and subject to:

- attribution,
- lineage preservation,
- slice-based royalty distribution,
- reforge governance.

### 5.2 Original Builder Floor

The Original Builder receives a permanent non-dilutable 30% of the Royalty Engine (85% of sale value).

### 5.3 Reforges

Major contributions that materially improve the Strata.
A reforge creates a new permanent royalty pool according to Guild rules.

After Reforge 3, additional reforges enter arbitration to determine:

- new Strata lineage,
- reforge-4+ pool logic,
- or bounty-only classification.

### 5.4 Bounties

Minor fixes or small patches funded by maintenance revenue.
Optional for Builders; no ongoing obligations.

## 6. Maintenance Ecosystem

(Activated in Phase 3)

The Guild may offer optional maintenance subscriptions that provide:

- patch bundles,
- compatibility updates,
- version governance,
- security fixes,
- reforge-aligned enhancements.

Maintenance funds flow exclusively to ShaleIO and are used for:

- patch bounties,
- reforge incentives,
- ecosystem stability.

Clients never receive direct infrastructure work.
Builders never owe maintenance unless they accept a bounty.

## . Revenue & Compensation
### 7.1 Guild Marketplace Sales

- 15% → Guild stewardship
- 85% → Royalty Engine (OB + Reforge pools)

### 7.2 Independent Sales under SGL

- 10% tithe to Guild
- 90% to Builder(s)

### 7.3 Non-SGL Independent Sales

Builders may sell their work under other licenses with no obligation to the Guild.
They may not use Guild marks or claim certification.

### 7.4 Client Referral (Non-SGL Service Work)

If ShaleIO delivers a client to a Builder for services, the Guild may charge a one-time 10% referral fee.
The Guild does not enter the contract.

## 8. Use of Guild Marks

“ShaleIO,” “ShaleIO Guild,” “ShaleIO Strata,” and "The Seal of the Forge" may only be used with:

- proper attribution,
- Guild certification,
- and compliance with the SGL.

Misuse results in immediate revocation of Guild privileges.

## 9. Arbitration
### 9.1 Scope

Arbitration covers only Guild matters:

- lineage,
- reforges,
- slice allocation,
- SGL compliance,
- brand misuse,
- tithe/royalty disputes.

### 9.2 Process

- Stewards review
- Guildmaster interprets
- Decision is final inside the Guild

### 9.3 External Disputes

Builder-client issues are outside Guild jurisdiction.

## 10. Termination

#### Grounds for termination:
- removal of attribution,
- misuse of Guild marks,
- nonpayment of royalties or tithe,
- breach of SGL or Charter,
- hostility or bad-faith behavior.

#### Termination revokes:
- certification,
- marketplace access,
- eligibility for reforges,
- use of Guild marks and identity.

Builders retain full ownership of their IP.

## 11. Prohibition on Publicly Traded Entities

Publicly traded corporations, their subsidiaries, majority-owned portfolio companies, and any organization directly controlled by a public entity are prohibited from joining the Guild or holding Builder status.

The Guild is designed for independent Builders, small LLCs, and privately held entities whose incentives align with the principles of sovereignty, ownership, and craft.

This rule ensures:
- independence of Builder contributions,
- avoidance of corporate capture or influence,
- preservation of Guild economics and lineage integrity,
- and protection of the ecosystem from scale-based distortion.

A publicly traded entity may purchase and use Strata products under standard SGL commercial terms, but may not join the Guild, earn slices, submit reforges, or claim any Builder or Steward designation.

## 12. Independent Builder Requirement

To preserve the independence, craft integrity, and non-corporate nature of the Guild, all Builders must operate as individually owned entities.

A Builder must be:
- an individual,
- or an LLC or equivalent entity that is solely or majority-owned by the individual Builder.

The following restrictions apply:

### No Organizational Direction
A Builder may not act under the direction, control, or strategic interests of any organization whose primary business is software development, consulting, or technology services.

### No Corporate Teams Acting as a Single Builder
Contributions must originate from the Builder personally or from subcontractors under the Builder’s direct control.
An employer, corporate group, or multi-employee team may not collectively act as a “Builder” for purposes of Guild participation.

### No Corporate Capture
Organizations—including privately held companies, venture-backed entities, and private-equity portfolio companies—may not use the Guild as a coordinated commercial production arm or as an extension of their internal engineering departments.

### Subcontracting Permitted
Builders may freely subcontract work, provided:

- the Builder retains IP ownership;
- subcontractors are not misrepresented as independent Builders;
- the work remains under the Builder’s individual creative direction.

### Enforcement and Review
The Guild may review Builder status if there is reasonable evidence that a Contributor is acting on behalf of, or under the strategic control of, a larger organization.

The Guild may revoke Builder status or deny certification where corporate capture or coordinated organizational participation is identified.

12.1 Purpose of This Clause

This requirement exists to:

- prevent multi-engineer organizations from dominating reforges or lineage,
- preserve individual craft sovereignty,
- maintain fair access to economic participation,
- avoid cartel-like behavior,
- protect the Guild from corporate influence,
- and ensure the Guild remains a collective of autonomous Builders rather than a corporate production network.

## 13. Amendment to the Charter

This Charter may be updated by the Guildmaster prior to activation.
After activation, amendments require review by Stewards and formal declaration by the Guildmaster.

## 14. Governing Law

This Charter is governed by the laws of the State of Florida, United States.

## 15. Closing Statement

The Guild exists for the Builders, not above them.
It grows only through craft, integrity, and creation.
The Guildmaster lays the foundation;
the Builders bring it to life;
the First Five awaken the Forge.

Until then, the Guild sleeps.
