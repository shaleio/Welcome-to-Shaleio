## **3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP**

Contributors retain full ownership of all original intellectual property they create.

By submitting a Licensed Work for certification, the Contributor grants Shaleio LLC a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive license to:

* distribute,
* certify,
* sublicense, and
* resell

the Licensed Work **within the Shaleio licensing framework only**.

Contributors may freely relicense or commercialize their work outside this framework without payment to Shaleio LLC.

Contributors retain all liability for any services, consulting engagements, or client-facing obligations.
Shaleio LLC is not a party to Contributor–client contracts.

### 3.1 Operational Continuity and Security Patch Rights

For the sole purposes of security, regulatory compliance, operational continuity, or critical functionality, the Contributor grants ShaleIO LLC a limited, non-exclusive right to modify, patch, or update the Licensed Work as reasonably necessary to:

- remediate security vulnerabilities,
- maintain compatibility with required third-party services,
- address breaking changes in dependent systems,
- or ensure continued functionality of Certified Products.

Any such modification must:

- preserve the Contributor’s ownership of all original intellectual property;
- not create derivative ownership rights for Shaleio LLC;
- be documented and provided to the Contributor for review and incorporation into their canonical version;
- not constitute a Material Enhancement for purposes of royalty allocation.
- Shaleio LLC shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Contributor of required changes prior to implementation, except where immediate action is necessary to address urgent security or operational risks.

### 3.2 Limitation of Liability for Continuity and Patch Work

Any maintenance, security patch, or operational continuity work performed or commissioned by ShaleIO LLC under Section 3.1 or Section 4.6 is provided on an “AS IS” basis and without any warranty.

ShaleIO LLC shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or defects arising from such modifications, including:

- security vulnerabilities introduced by the patch,
- operational failures,
- data loss,
- service interruption,
- or any consequential, incidental, or special damages.

All liability for modifications made under these sections remains with the party who authored the modification.
No continuity activity creates any duty of care, maintenance obligation, or ongoing support commitment for Shaleio LLC.

## **4. ROYALTY DISTRIBUTION MODEL**

All sales of Certified Products follow the fixed revenue structure below.

### **4.1 Sales Through Shaleio LLC**

For each sale:

* **15%** → Shaleio LLC (Administrative Licensing Fee)
* **85%** → Royalty Distribution Structure

### **4.2 Original Contributor Allocation**

The original Contributor receives a perpetual, non-dilutable **30%** of the Royalty Distribution Structure.

### **4.3 Enhancement Royalty Pools**

Each Material Enhancement approved as a major version upgrade creates a permanent Enhancement Royalty Pool:

* **Pool A** (first enhancement)
* **Pool B** (second enhancement)
* **Pool C** (third enhancement)

Example for a $100 sale:

* $15 → Shaleio LLC
* $85 → Royalty Distribution Structure

  * Original Contributor: $25.50
  * Pool A: $34.00
  * Pool B: $25.50

### **4.4 Enhancements Beyond Pool C**

After the third major enhancement, the Licensing Review Committee will determine whether the contribution constitutes:

* a new Certified Product,
* a limited royalty pool, or
* maintenance or bounty-only work.

The Licensing Executive’s final determination is binding within the scope of this License.

---

### **4.5 Bounty Contributors**

Work classified as maintenance-level contributions shall be designated as Bounty Contributions and do not create or participate in any Royalty Pools.

### 4.6 Continuity of Maintenance

If the Original Contributor is unable or unwilling to maintain a Certified Product, respond to critical issues, or provide required updates for a continuous period of 180 days, ShaleIO LLC may authorize another Contributor to develop a Material Enhancement or perform necessary maintenance solely to ensure ongoing functionality, security, or compliance.

In such cases:

- The Original Contributor retains all existing royalty rights and percentages assigned under the Royalty Distribution Structure;
- Any new Material Enhancements created under this clause shall form new Enhancement Royalty Pools allocated to the contributing party as determined by the Licensing Review Committee;
- All modifications must be documented and offered to the Original Contributor for incorporation upon their return;
- Continuity actions taken under this clause do not transfer ownership of the underlying Licensed Work to Shaleio LLC or to any other Contributor.

This clause exists solely to ensure operational continuity and does not diminish the Original Contributor’s intellectual property rights.

The Original Contributor may, at their discretion, opt out of the Continuity of Maintenance provision by providing written notice to Shaleio LLC.

If an opt-out notice is submitted, Shaleio LLC shall not authorize Material Enhancements or continuity maintenance by third parties except where required to address urgent security vulnerabilities or compliance issues as outlined in Section 3.1.

## **5. INDEPENDENT SALES BY CONTRIBUTORS**

Contributors may independently sell Licensed Works governed by this License.

Revenue allocation:

* **90%** → Contributor
* **10%** → Shaleio LLC (Independent Sales Fee)

Payments are due within 60 days of receipt.

Independent sales must maintain required attribution and Contribution Records.

---

## **6. EXTERNAL LICENSING OUTSIDE THIS LICENSE**

Contributors may sell, modify, or relicense their original work outside the Shaleio licensing framework with:

* no fee,
* no obligation, and
* no revenue share owed to Shaleio LLC.

Externally licensed products may not claim SGL certification or use any Shaleio trademarks or certification marks.

---

## **7. THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS**

### **7.1 Definition of a Distribution Event**

Any resale or listing of a Certified Product on a public digital marketplace constitutes a Distribution Event, distinct from consulting-based deployment.

### **7.2 Authorization Requirement**

Distribution Events are prohibited unless the reseller is a Shaleio-approved **Certified Distributor**.

### **7.3 Distributor Obligations**

Certified Distributors must comply with Shaleio standards, including:

* pricing restrictions,
* discount limitations,
* verification requirements,
* quality standards, and
* revenue-sharing obligations.

### **7.4 Unauthorized Resale**

Unauthorized marketplace listings, derivative storefronts, rebranded catalogs, or attempts to bypass certification constitute a material breach.

#### **7.5 Consulting Deployments**

For any Deployment of Guild-Licensed Products performed as part of a commercial engagement, the Consultant shall remit to ShaleIO LLC (“the Guild”) a Consulting Deployment Fee equal to the greater of:

(a) fifteen percent (15%) of the Consultant’s Net Profit attributable to the engagement, or
(b) fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate Guild List Price(s) of all Guild Products deployed, calculated per-deployment.

For avoidance of doubt, discounts, bundling, promotional pricing, service-only invoices, or zero-cost product line items shall not reduce or waive the minimum royalty obligation described in subsection (b).

Each Deployment event constitutes a separate and independent royalty obligation, regardless of whether multiple products are deployed within a single client engagement.

Failure to register a Deployment within ten (10) business days shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate revocation of Consultant status and access to Guild-Licensed Products.

#### **7.5.1 Allocation of Consulting Deployment Fee**

ShaleIO LLC shall allocate each Consulting Deployment Fee as follows:

- 15% retained by ShaleIO LLC as the Administrative Licensing Fee; and
- 85% distributed pursuant to the Guild’s Royalty Distribution Structure to the Original Contributor(s) and applicable Enhancement Royalty Pools, allocated pro rata based on each Product’s Guild List Price.

#### **7.5.2 Payment Terms**

Payments shall be remitted to ShaleIO LLC within sixty (60) days of the Consultant’s receipt of client payment for the engagement, or within sixty (60) days of Deployment registration, whichever occurs first.

Interest on late payments may be assessed in accordance with Section 11.

## **8. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS**

All Licensed Works must include:

* original Contributor attribution,
* Contribution Record where applicable,
* Shaleio certification notice (for Certified Products).

Attribution must be clear, visible, and retained in derivative works.

Removal of required attribution is a material breach of this License.

---

## **9. TRADEMARKS**

“Shaleio,” “Shaleio Guild License,” “SGL,” “Certified Product,” and the “Shaleio Certification Mark” are trademarks of Shaleio LLC.

* business interruption,
* or any liability arising from use or deployment of Licensed Works.

Contributors are exclusively responsible for obligations arising from their client engagements.

### **11. Late Payments**

Any amounts not paid when due under this Agreement shall accrue interest from the due date until paid in full at the lesser of (a) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In addition to interest, the Guild may suspend the Consultant’s access to Guild-Licensed Products, updates, and related services for so long as any undisputed amount remains more than thirty (30) days past due.
