# 📘 ShaleIO Master Blueprint v1.0
A Builder-First Economic System for Cloud-Native Software

Author: Alexander Moryan
Status: Draft
Version: 1.0

## 1. Mission

ShaleIO exists to create a builder-owned, serverless-first software economy based on:

- financial transparency
- ownership (not SaaS rent)
- high-quality engineering
- ethical revenue distribution
- long-term sustainability

ShaleIO is not a SaaS company.
ShaleIO is not a consultancy.
ShaleIO is a Guild — an ecosystem for independent builders to create, certify, and sell cloud-native systems that clients fully own.

## 2. Core Economic Model

ShaleIO’s economic engine is defined by the ShaleIO Guild License (SGL).

### 2.1 Royalty Structure

- 85% of revenue → Builders
- 15% → ShaleIO (Stewardship Fee)

### 2.2 Builder Ownership

Builders retain full IP ownership of their original work.
ShaleIO receives a non-exclusive license to:

- distribute
- certify
- resell
- manage lineage

within the ShaleIO ecosystem only.

### 2.3 Reforge System

Significant improvements (“Material Enhancements”) create permanent royalty pools:

- Original Builder: 30%
- Reforge A: 40%
- Reforge B: 30% (example allocation)

This ensures:

- incentive alignment
- high-quality evolution
- preserved lineage
- fair attribution

## 3. Product Strategy (Strata Series)

Strata are serverless, AWS-native systems delivered as:

- reproducible IaC
- documented configurations
- deployable templates
- fully inspectable source

Example verticals:

- StrataBI (Dash, Athena, Glue, Iceberg analytics)
- StrataCI (GitLab CE or similar on Fargate)
- StrataETL
- StrataFinOps

future categories as the Guild grows

All Strata share:

- open architecture
- serverless runtime
- low operational cost
- reproducible builds
- zero lock-in
- measurable ROI

## 4. Marketplace Architecture

The Marketplace is the economic hub of the Guild.

### Phase 1 (Now)

- Manual sales
- Stripe/PayPal
- GitHub releases
- Manual royalty calculation
- Manual certification

### Phase 2 (Next 6 months)

- Automated purchase portal
- Attribution validation
- Contributor dashboard
- Royalty ledger
- Version tracking
- Metadata ingestion (shaleio.json)

### Phase 3 (12–18 months)

- Automated certification
- Absorbing reforges into lineage
- Maintenance subscription tiers
- Steward oversight

### Phase 4 (2–4 years)

- SGL-compliant metadata standard adopted by external registries (PyPI/npm/DockerHub)
- Federation with existing registries
- Cross-category expansion beyond cloud
- SGR: ShaleIO Guild Registry (optional, federated, not centralized)

## 5. Governance Structure
### 5.1 Guildmaster

Founder-level role.
Interprets SGL.
Maintains Charter.
Oversees lineage.

### 5.2 Stewards (Phase 3)

Administrators responsible for:

- certification
- reforge arbitration
- compliance
- quality control

### 5.3 Builders

Independent LLCs who:

- own their IP
- submit Strata
- participate in reforges
- earn royalties
- maintain sovereignty

Builders are never employees of ShaleIO.

### 6. Maintenance Ecosystem (Phase 3)

- ShaleIO offers optional maintenance tiers:
- security patches
- version updates
- compatibility fixes
- accelerator bounties

Builders do not owe support unless they accept a bounty.
Maintenance ensures long-term Strata stability without creating SaaS lock-in.

### 7. Technical Standards (SCPS v1.0 Overview)

ShaleIO Certification & Publishing Standard governs:

- metadata (shaleio.json)
- publishing workflow
- attribution integrity
- certification criteria
- versioning discipline
- build reproducibility
- security hygiene

Registries host artifacts.
ShaleIO governs economics.

### 8. Client Value Proposition
Own your stack. Don’t rent it.

Clients receive:

- fully ownable cloud systems
- serverless, low-cost architectures
- security transparency
- no hidden runtime fees
- certified quality
- predictable upgrades
- vendor-neutral infrastructure

This is the anti-SaaS movement.

### 9. Builder Value Proposition

Builders receive:

- IP ownership
- 85% revenue
- long-term lineage royalties
- recognition of craft
- no corporate capture
- no SaaS contract liability
- a path to multi-year passive income
- a real alternative to W-2 stagnation

This is the ethical engineering ecosystem missing in today’s industry.

### 10. Roadmap (High-Level)
#### Phase 1 — Genesis (0–6 months)

- Launch StrataBI + StrataCI
- Publish SGL v1.6
- Create website + repo presence
- Manual sales + manual certification
- Onboard First Five Builders

#### Phase 2 — Activation (6–18 months)

- Marketplace automation
- Contributor dashboards
- Royalty ledger
- SCPS enforcement
- 5–10 Strata live
- First reforge cycles

#### Phase 3 — Guild Era (1–3 years)

- Maintenance tiers
- Stewards appointed
- Expanded Strata lines
- Dedicated ecosystem revenue
- Corporate adoption accelerates

#### Phase 4 — Federation (3–6 years)

- SGR: federated registry model
- Metadata adoption across PyPI/npm/etc.
- Multi-domain software categories enter the Guild
- Long-term immutability of lineage

This makes ShaleIO structurally immortal.

### 11. Philosophy

ShaleIO is based on five principles:

- Ownership over rental
- Craft over complexity
- Fairness over extraction
- Sovereignty over employment hierarchies
- Transparency over black-box SaaS

These are not slogans.
These are the incentives baked into the system architecture.

### 12. What ShaleIO Is Ultimately Building

Not a product.
Not a tool.
Not a consultancy.

ShaleIO is creating the first decentralized, builder-owned software economy where:

- clients own their infrastructure
- builders own their IP
- revenue is shared fairly
- lineage outlives individuals
- systems improve through reforges
- engineering becomes a craft again

This is the post-SaaS era.

### 13. Status (as of 2025)

- SGL v1.6 complete
- Charter complete
- SCPS drafted
- Strata prototypes in development
- Brand established
- Readme v0.9
- Roadmap confirmed
