# Strata Maintenance Packages — Draft (For Builders)

This document outlines the **future maintenance tier system** for Strata. It is **NOT active for Phase 1**, but exists to show Builders the long-term Guild economics and support model.

The Maintenance Program begins once:

* multiple Strata exist,
* reforges are happening,
* and the Guild has at least a few active Builders.

Maintenance funds are paid **directly to ShaleIO** and distributed via:

* bounties,
* reforge pool incentives,
* and Guild operational stewardship.

The Builder never owes maintenance labor unless they choose to accept a bounty.

# ⭐ Overview

Maintenance subscriptions provide clients with:

* regular patch releases,
* version compatibility updates,
* security fixes,
* reforge alignment,
* extended support windows,
* access to Guild-backed lifecycle guarantees.

Clients apply updates themselves; the Guild never touches client infrastructure.

# ⭐ Builder Compensation Model

Maintenance revenue is used to:

* fund bounties for patch-level tasks,
* fund reforge incentives,
* stabilize Strata quality,
* ensure longevity and compatibility.

Builders earn through:

* bounties they choose to complete,
* reforge pool slices when significant updates are made,
* increased Strata sales due to ecosystem health.

Builders are **never obligated** to perform maintenance unless they voluntarily accept a bounty.

---

# ⭐ Canonical Rules

* **Maintenance money always goes to the Guild.**
* **Maintenance funds reforges, not runtime operations.**
* **Clients apply updates; the Guild provides updated Strata.**
* **Maintenance begins only after the Guild is active.**

---

# Status

This file exists to show Builders how Phase 3 will operate. It should **not** be presented to clients until the Guild reaches maturity.
