# 🪨 Welcome to **Shaleio**

**A Cloud Guild.**  
We build **lean, serverless AWS systems** that cut costs by up to **70%**.  
No subscriptions. No lock-in. Just results.

> Don't rent SaaS. Own your stack.

### 🧭 What Is Shaleio?

Shaleio is a **builder guild** — not a consultancy, not a platform.  
Our mission is to create **serverless cloud systems** that are  
fast, transparent, and financially sane.

- ⚙️ **Serverless-first**: Glue, Lambda, Athena, Iceberg, S3 — AWS native.  
- 💰 **FinOps-driven**: measurable ROI and cost transparency baked in.  
- 🧱 **Ownable architecture**: clients own their stack, builders own their code.  
- 🧠 **Open philosophy**: craftsmanship over SaaS dependency.

### ⚔️ The Guild Philosophy

> “Code is craft. Builders are guild members. Clients are patrons.”

We don’t sell seats or licenses — we deliver **ownership**.  
Every Shaleio build is open, inspectable, and serverless by design.

Our creed:
1. **Autonomy** — Builders own their work.  
2. **Efficiency** — Every dollar spent must yield measurable ROI.  
3. **Transparency** — No black-box SaaS.  
4. **Craftsmanship** — Quality over complexity.  
5. **Community** — Collaboration without corporatism.
